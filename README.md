# POSTMAN
Here we have made the Frontend and the backend of the POSTMAN using express, sqlite3, JS, React and other tools.
day 27 | Backend | POSTMAN FRONTEND

So as a backend developer we shoudl know about frontend as well to show case our skills
REACT 
so when we change the HTML element changes are not reflected fast so we use js and we see what are the changes that are required .
we make the dom tree and see what are the changes that have beeen done to them and we so it using keys as we assign keys to every tree node, this is called Reconcilation.
that is whole React , React is library not framework.
nest.js is backend framework and next.js is frontend framework. these provide webpacks and babel
babel is basically a converter of ES6 to ES5 code which most of the browsers understand, modern js to old js.

data comes in two types in react -state local.
2- props coming from parents. 
see the photos
it makes the database and put all the changes there and see what change have been done

app.js has fuction < like this> and we so that js do not get confused and we created out routes over there
and in main.js we have reduc store where we call action to store it in the db.

day 26 | Backend | POSTMAN backend
so postman is the tool to make an api call and it uses fetch or axios to do that but it has beutiful api to do that. Its has feature called collection for which it is famous for where it saves the api call and the required data and then we can share it to anyone.
everything api call in the system is made using the curl which is the low level api call making thihng present in every system.pacakages uses the curl to make the api call.
on clicking on handlesubmit it backs the api call to backend and save the result and this all we wanted, we have to make every thing more atomic and then we have to put down our thougths in whatever language is requred
dispatch is updating the redux tool
